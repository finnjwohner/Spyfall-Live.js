          <li>
            <strong>Location: </strong>When the round starts, each player except
            for the spy is told the location, and is given a role there. The spy
            does not know the location.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Question: </strong>The player who started the round begins
            by questioning a player of their choice about the location, for
            example <i>"How was your commute here today?</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Answer: </strong>The questioned player must answer. No
            follow up questions are allowed. After they answer they get to
            question a different player. This continues until the round is over.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Retaliation: </strong>If someone just finished asking you
            a question, you can not immediately ask them a question back.

            <li>
